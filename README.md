# KnightDungeon
A game in pygame to escape a dungeon

This was a fun project. I learnt:

- How to use the the MAP to define the game space
- how to convert x and y positions to coordinates
- how to accept in put from the player to enable movment, and how to repeat that movement
- how to crat the background using the map and images
- how to create and animate the actors
- how to move the actors that arent the player
- how to schedule events to take place

I think i'll come back to this game and make it more interesting in the fuutre.
